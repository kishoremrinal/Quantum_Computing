1. **What is computing? what are the various approaches of computing and what next generation computing may look like**

<details>
<summary>Computing & Different approaches of computing:</summary>

  **Computing** is the process of using physical systems to represent information and change it according to rules to get meaningful results.

A system is computing if it can

* Represent information

* Apply rules to that information

* Produce predictable results

**What Makes a “Good” Computing Device?**

A good computing device is one that:

1. Is reliable – same input → same output

1. Is accurate – follows rules correctly

1. Is fast – finishes in less time

1. Is efficient – uses less energy/resources

1. Is scalable – works for small and big problems

1. Is programmable – can do many tasks, not just one

**Different Approaches to Computing**
  1. Neuromorphic Computing
  1. DNA based Computing
  1. Chemical Computing
  1. Quantum COmputing

**1. Neuromorphic Computing**

Inspired by the human brain.

Uses artificial “neurons” and “synapses.”

Strength: pattern recognition, learning, low power.

Used for: AI, vision, speech, robotics.

**2. DNA-Based Computing**

Uses DNA molecules to store and process information.

Strength: massive parallelism and data density.

Used for: complex optimization, biological simulations.

**3. Chemical Computing**

Uses chemical reactions to perform computation.

Logic emerges from reaction patterns.

Used for: modeling biological or physical systems.

**4. Quantum Computing**

Uses qubits (superposition, entanglement).

Strength: solves certain problems exponentially faster.

Used for: cryptography, chemistry, optimization, AI research.
