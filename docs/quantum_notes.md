1. **What is computing? what are the various approaches of computing and what next generation computing may look like**

<details>
<summary>Computing & Different approaches of computing:</summary>

  **Computing** is the process of using physical systems to represent information and change it according to rules to get meaningful results.

A system is computing if it can

* Represent information

* Apply rules to that information

* Produce predictable results

**What Makes a “Good” Computing Device?**

A good computing device is one that:

1. Is reliable – same input → same output

1. Is accurate – follows rules correctly

1. Is fast – finishes in less time

1. Is efficient – uses less energy/resources

1. Is scalable – works for small and big problems

1. Is programmable – can do many tasks, not just one

**Different Approaches to Computing**
  1. Neuromorphic Computing
  1. DNA based Computing
  1. Chemical Computing
  1. Quantum COmputing
