#**CLASSICAL COMPUTERS:**

***. Why computer is considered as one of the greatest human invention? what problems did it solved?***
Core Purpose of Classical Computers:
* Store large amounts of information
* Process data quickly and accurately
* Automate routine work
* Enable large-scale systems (banks, airlines, internet, research, defense, healthcare)
They turn human ideas into executable logic at massive speed.

*** What are the core concepts of number systems used for calculations be it binary or decimal number systems:

Number Systems — Conceptual Refresher
1) What is a Number System

A number system is a way to write quantities using symbols.
The quantity is the same; only the writing changes with the base.

2) Base

Base = how many symbols you can use before rollover.

In base-N:

Allowed digits: 0 to N−1

You never write the base itself as a digit.

When a digit reaches N, you carry.

Example (base-5):
Digits: 0,1,2,3,4
After 4 → 10₅ (carry happens)

3) Place Values

Each position means a power of the base.

In base-10: 1,10,100…
In base-2: 1,2,4,8…

Meaning:

Digits are symbols, but their meaning comes from position.

Example:
1011₂ = 1×8 + 0×4 + 1×2 + 1×1 = 11

4) Rollover (Carry)

When a digit hits the base, reset and carry.

Example:
In base-2: 1 → next is 10₂
In base-10: 9 → next is 10

5) Role of 0

0 means “no quantity in this place.”

Example:
105 = 1×100 + 0×10 + 5×1
0 is a structural placeholder.

6) Binary (Computer Base)

Base-2 uses digits: 0 and 1
Powers: 1,2,4,8,16…

Example:
8 = 1000₂

7) Another Base (Twist Thinking: Base-6)

Base-6 digits: 0–5
Powers: 1,6,36…

Example:
42₁₀ = 110₆
Because: 1×36 + 1×6 + 0×1 = 42

Final Core Idea

Quantity is independent of base.

Base decides symbols and rollover rule.

Position gives meaning.

Carry happens at the base.

0 holds empty places. </summary>
