# CLASSICAL COMPUTERS

1. **Why is the computer considered one of the greatest human inventions? What problems did it solve?**  
   Core Purpose of Classical Computers:
   - Store large amounts of information
   - Process data quickly and accurately
   - Automate routine work
   - Enable large-scale systems (banks, airlines, internet, research, defense, healthcare)  
     They turn human ideas into executable logic at massive speed.

2. **How do we represent ‘how many’ using symbols, and why do different bases change the writing but not the quantity?**

### 1) What is a Number System
A number system is a way to write quantities using symbols.  
The quantity is the same; only the writing changes with the base.

### 2) Base
Base = how many symbols you can use before rollover.  
In base-N:
- Allowed digits: 0 to N−1  
- You never write the base itself as a digit.  
- When a digit reaches N, you carry.  

Example (base-5):  
Digits: 0,1,2,3,4  
After 4 → 10₅

### 3) Place Values
Each position means a power of the base.  
- Base-10: 1,10,100…  
- Base-2: 1,2,4,8…  

Example:  
1011₂ = 1×8 + 0×4 + 1×2 + 1×1 = 11

### 4) Rollover (Carry)
- Base-2: 1 → 10₂  
- Base-10: 9 → 10

### 5) Role of 0
0 is a placeholder for empty position.  
105 = 1×100 + 0×10 + 5×1

### 6) Binary
Digits: 0 and 1  
Powers: 1,2,4,8…  
8 = 1000₂

### 7) Base-6 Example
42₁₀ = 110₆  
1×36 + 1×6 + 0×1 = 42

### Final Core Idea
- Quantity is independent of base  
- Base decides symbols and carry  
- Position gives meaning  
- 0 holds empty places
